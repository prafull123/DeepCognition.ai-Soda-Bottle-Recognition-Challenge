# DeepCognition.ai-Soda-Bottle-Recognition-Challenge
As mentioned on the wesite of DeepCognition.ai -- 

Problem Statement - 
Today soda bottle companies send a person to stores to find out if they need to restock some soda bottles that have run out on weekly basis. There are 100s of thousands of these coolers at different stores all across the world. This takes large amount of human labor in travel and counting bottles. Soda companies also miss sales if these coolers ran out of a soda bottle in middle of week. To solve this problem with a camera and software, AI is needed to identify bottles in an image of cooler. This is essentially image classification task. Bottles will not always be facing forward and sometimes lighting may not be ideal.

In this challenge, you will have to build a deep learning model using Deep Learning Studio that can learn to correctly classify an image of a soda bottle. A pre labeled dataset of images is provided to train your neural network. You can download dataset for this challenge from dataset tab.

Objective - 
"The objective of this challenge is to identify which soda bottle is present in the image. We provide you a pre-labeled dataset that you will use to build and train a deep learning AI model. 

We will measure accuracy of your model on a private set of samples when you submit your model for evaluation."
